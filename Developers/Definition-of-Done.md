Definition of Done for a User Story
================================

> When a user story is described as "Done", everyone much understand what "Done" means. 

- Scrum Guide

By all following this definition of done, we can ensure that we all complete a common set of tasks for every user story we do.

- [ ] Code produced (all ‘to do’ items in code completed)
- [ ] Builds without errors and applications run (e.g. no circular dependency issues)
- [ ] Latest `master` merged in, and pushed to GitHub with correct branch name
- [ ] Comments added to code
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Minimum dev-test requirements met (as defined in the User Story)
- [ ] Code reviewed (if required) and meets coding standards
- [ ] Deployed to test environment, testing advice given
- [ ] Issue tracking system up to date (estimates, status)
