# Pull Requests and Code Reviews

#### What is a pull request and how do I create one?

Pull requests give us a structured way to submit a piece of work for code review, easily see the code changes made, record feedback, and accept the change into a particular branch. 

GitHub have a good page all about this, see [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
At the moment code reviews have to be done via the web interface for github.com, however, they are working on [bringing this functionality to Visual Studio](https://github.com/github/VisualStudio/issues/491).
